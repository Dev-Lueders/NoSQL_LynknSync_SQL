User Instructions for auto_commit.ps1

Purpose
This PowerShell script automates Git commits by maintaining a commit count, appending timestamps, and ensuring auto_commit.ps1 is ignored in .gitignore. It also prompts the user to select a commit name if it's the first time running.

Setup & First-Time Use
1. Ensure Git is Installed
Before running this script, make sure Git is installed and configured on your system.

To check, run:

git --version

2. Navigate to the Repository
Ensure you are in the correct Git repository where you want to run the script. Use:
cd path\to\your\repo

3. Run the Script
Execute the script using:
./auto_commit.ps1

Script Behavior & Execution Steps

Scenario 1: First-Time Setup (No commit_count.txt Found)

The script detects that commit_count.txt is missing.

It prompts you to select a name for your commit messages:
1 for GitHub Username
2 for Windows Username
3 to enter your initials manually

A new commit_count.txt file is created with the selected name and an initial commit count of 0.
You will need to rerun the script to proceed with the first commit.

Scenario 2: Normal Execution (After commit_count.txt Exists)
The script verifies that commit_count.txt contains valid data.
It checks if auto_commit.ps1 is already in .gitignore and adds it if necessary.
It reads the stored username and commit count.
It prompts for a custom commit message.
The commit message format is:
php-template

#<commit_number> - <custom_message> - <timestamp> - (Committed by: <username>)

The script automatically stages, commits, and pushes changes to the current branch.

Handling Errors
Issue: Cannot index into a null array
This occurs if commit_count.txt is empty or missing required data.
The script automatically resets the file if corruption is detected. 
***Your commits are still in GitHub if the file is corrupt
To continue where you left off for commit count, check your GitHub repository and add the latest to your 2nd line in commit_count.txt

Issue: auto_commit.ps1 is already in .gitignore
This is an informational message. If it appears, no action is needed.

Manually Editing commit_count.txt
If you want to change the stored username:

Open commit_count.txt in a text editor.
Modify the first line with your preferred name.
Save the file.

# First Run (Sets up commit_count.txt)
./auto_commit.ps1

# Rerun to commit changes
./auto_commit.ps1
